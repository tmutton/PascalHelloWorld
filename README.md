# Hello World
Simple Hello World program using Pascal.

## Background (why would you want to play around with an old language such as Pascal?)
I was taught the fundamentals of programming using Pascal at college. For that reason Pascal is sentimental to me; it's good to go back to basics sometimes.

Back in my college days we used the Turbo Pascal compiler. This time I'm using Free Pascal Compiler (it's available here http://www.freepascal.org). Compiling your code is non-trivial (I'm currently using Windows) 

> open cmd prompt 
> find the compiler exe and pass in your source file

Pascal is a nice little language to learn if you're new to programming and it's free.
